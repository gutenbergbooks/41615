<h2>TUFFY TODD'S ADVENTURE.</h2>
<hr />

<div class="poemcontainer">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There is a little dog whose name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is Tuffy Todd, who has the same<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wise look as many a dog you've met;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And is a well-bred house-dog pet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But quaintly called in rhyme a hound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To please the poet's ear for sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round as a mole, he's fat and fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And robed in coat of whitest hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His soft brown eyes are bright and clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His little ears are quick to hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He has a kind expressive face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With every feature full of grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In disposition meek and mild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's gentle as a little child;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But has his own peculiar way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As all who hear will surely say.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 06]</span>
He is to people so polite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You'd think he'd never bark or bite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But strangers climbing up the hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will shout in vain: "You hound, be still!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And traveler late in midnight dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is sure to hear Tuff's loudest bark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While tramps who come about the yard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must flee or face a valiant guard.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Although he has a host of friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To them he rarely condescends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their caresses kindly made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are with indifference coldly paid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lives for Master Orrin Todd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And worships him as household god;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With him Tuff wildly romps and plays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from his side but seldom strays.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At times when Orrin goes away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tarry but a single day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bids his Tuffy stay behind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And try to have a peaceful mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Tuff, so sad and desolate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies down alone to meditate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or seeks the porch&mdash;a sunny place&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 07]</span>
To watch for Todd's returning face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or wait until the voice so dear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall fall like music on his ear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unmoved by other sight or sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lies as if in thought profound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Call him, he seems both deaf and dumb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless you say: "Ho! <i>Orrin's</i> come!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When quick, like one from sleep, he springs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flies, as swift as bird on wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet his master and his friend,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Tuffy's mourning has an end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ways eccentric may appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in the sequel they'll be clear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now little Tuff, it may seem strange,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had lived at home, nor thought of change;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But one calm morning clear and bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if new visions filled his sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To <i>Griffin's Corners</i> begged a ride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Orrin's wagon by his side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good Master Todd could not deny<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pleading of poor Tuffy's eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said: "Jump in and take a seat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you shall have a royal treat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 08]</span>
For though we go by mountain road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And do not want a heavy load,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our sprightly horses strong and true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will never mind a mite like you."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Tuff leaped in and sat erect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if to show his intellect,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When off they rode with hearts of glee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And warmer friends you rarely see.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Orrin thought it would be nice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To give his Tuffy some advice:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Be careful, Tuffy mine," said he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"We go where many dangers be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn not aside nor leave my track<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till setting sun shall warn us back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In town you will a stranger be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again I say: Go not from me."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To which the simple dog replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh, never will I leave thy side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But follow where thy footsteps lead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou dearest friend in time of need."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Our Tuff can talk like dogs of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of whom in fable Æsop told.)<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 09]</span>
Then Todd, to pass away the time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus entertained his guest in rhyme:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I've always made you stay at home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never let you widely roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because I feared you might be lost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by the world be rudely tossed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or lest in some unlucky way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You might be hurt as on that day&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That doleful, direful day,&mdash;when life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And death seemed balanced in the strife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You then were but a little pup,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a snail could scarce keep up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But seeing Flora's gentle pace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You thought with her you'd run a race!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as she moved along the road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pulled with care her heavy load,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You chanced to fall beneath the wheel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which crushed your leg and made you reel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O dreadful sight! O fearful cry!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mangled limb! no surgeon nigh!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stanched the blood which freely flowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in my arms&mdash;a tiny load&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bore you safely to our door;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then said: 'You shall go out no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 10]</span>
Until your leg is fully healed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or death shall take you from the field!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I set and bandaged well your limb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Should surgeon doubt, I'd challenge him,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laid you on an easy bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw that you were kindly fed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I closely watched you night and day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And did not fail for you to pray!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When you had reached the third long week,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thank God! (with reverence do I speak)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas plain you needed nothing more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than just to walk about the floor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length, when people thought you dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You left your room and little bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"He's <i>tough</i>," they said, "as hickory rod,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And called you "<i>Tough</i>," then Tuffy Todd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus you see it strangely came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You have a soft and pretty name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now since to perfect health restored,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thank me well you can afford."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tuff answered: "Do you doubt, dear friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I shall thank you to the end?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since I was struck by wheel so rude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 11]</span>
Have I not shown you gratitude?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have I not always been to you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obedient, faithful, good and true?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through evil and through good report<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've never failed in my support!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsaking friends, let none deny<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For you I've lived, for you I'll die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What care I for the world around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all my joy in you is found?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Please pardon if too bold I seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hold me firm in your esteem."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I did not mean to grieve your heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good Tuff, nor cause a single smart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But just to have a little play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought I'd see what you would say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In answer to my sober talk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While slow the horses onward walk."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Conversing thus as friend with friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last they reach their journey's end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Todd's heart with anxious fears beset,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foreboding peril to his pet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He turns to Tuffy: "You've been warned<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 12]</span>
In language clear and unadorned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stay by me and to beware<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of dangers lurking everywhere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although no prophet born or bred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though on my mind no light is shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fear from knowledge of your race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The day will end in your disgrace</i>."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Out jumped brave Tuff and Farmer Todd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But scarce had gone a single rod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before they heard: "Bow-wow! Friend Tuff!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that's your name I'm sure enough;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How glad I am to see your face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give to you a friend's embrace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now while in town, stay thou with me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And boon companions we will be."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Tuff, (poor "Innocent abroad,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who never dreamed of any fraud,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Replied: "Perhaps we've met before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll take your word and ask no more:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It would not seem polite, I know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should I refuse with you to go."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away they marched, as large as life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their hearts with hope and pleasure rife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 13]</span>
And wandered in their heedless play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through many a dark and devious way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unchecked they raced and chased around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lawless cur and recreant hound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They took no note of time, nor cared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How far they strayed nor how they fared;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Tuff could not foresee his woes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till darkness did around him close.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, Tuffy, born and reared in ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bread enough to eat and cheese,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where now thy master's tender care?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where now the bed thou erst didst share?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy new-made friend all false will be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In time of thy adversity!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the cold, cold ground to-night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sleep shall come ere morning light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor morsel sweet for hungry maw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor peace for nature's broken law!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The westering sun had low declined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When homeward with an easy mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good Orrin turned his horses' feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Expecting there his dog to meet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 14]</span>
But drawing near, no Tuff was found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To greet him with accustomed sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor Orrin could not sleep a wink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lay awake all night to think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How sad the fate of Tuff might be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who late was in prosperity.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Back, in the early morning bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Griffin's Orrin took his flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thoughts of Tuff so filled his mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No other thought a place could find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he passed each neighbor's door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas little known the load he bore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dogs ran out and barked so bold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They wakened echoes in the wold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While ducks and geese joined in the strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quacked and screamed for their dear life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then proudly crowed vain chanticleer:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I am, you see, without a peer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let none within my realm intrude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To scare my hens and little brood."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But patient kine in farmyard pent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were mute with meek-eyed wonderment,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 15]</span>
While grazing sheep on hillside near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard all and said: "We need not fear;"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each mother called her own dear lamb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who answered back: "Oh, here I am!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The squirrel with his nimble feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now quickly found a safe retreat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the wall, or limb on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peeped slyly out as Todd went by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The birds from out the leafy trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So gently swayed by morning breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poured forth their notes in merry lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sang: "Good speed and happy day!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And insect world, on joyous wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sunlight clear did sweetly sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or hum in myriad tones so gay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"We cheer the traveler on his way."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ferns and flowers in wayside beds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With meek surprise did lift their heads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whisper low: "Our friend's in haste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And has no time on us to waste.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In days gone by he'd stop awhile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To praise our charms and make us smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or take us in his gentle hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if rare gifts from foreign lands."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 16]</span>
And thus each loving, living thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had kindly thought or word to bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which proved a balm to soothe Todd's soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he moved onward to his goal.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The livelong day through street and lane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sought his dog, but sought in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From house to house he asked each man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Where's Tuff? Pray tell me if you can."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why, Tuff has gone with Bruno Brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dog," they said, "of poor renown."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was enough to turn one's brain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To always hear this sad refrain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Retracing now in twilight drear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His weary steps, Todd dropped a tear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And took with heavy heart the way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His feet had pressed at opening day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And walked in doubt and gloom along<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where late he sang his cheerful song,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where frisked his faithful dog with glee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kept him joyful company.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Poor Tuff, a wanderer forlorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now loud bewailed that he was born!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

For though in darkness and in grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There came no friend to his relief.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But being born he did not care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just then to die. With reason rare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He searched along the dusty ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see where footprints could be found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he with keen instinctive nose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discerned the course of Orrin's toes!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then light and hope began to rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cheer the darkness of his skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While slow he kept the lonely road<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which led him safe to his abode.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce twelve had struck the kitchen clock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When lo! was heard a scratch or knock.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh!" said his wife: "Oh, Orrin dear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The lost is found; our Tuff is here!</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then up sprang Orrin with a bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And welcomed home his truant hound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose downcast eye and trembling frame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betrayed a sense of guilt and shame.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Todd in sweet forgiving mood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spread Tuff a couch and gave him food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 18]</span>
And bade him now find rest in sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus forget his sorrows deep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Tuff in silence ate his meal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But made by looks this sad appeal:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh friend, in sorrow and in cheer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's none on earth as you so dear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all the trouble I have brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am not worthy of your thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would receive a just return<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should you my presence coldly spurn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or from me turn with angry frown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let me in despair sink down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will not plead in self-defence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor try to prove my innocence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But truth requires that I should say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How I was duped and led astray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By cunning dog, who boldly claimed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'd seen my home ere I was named&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had heard of Tuffy Todd before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When passing by our cottage door!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He led me captive at his will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made me suffer direst ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was no more than I deserved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who from the path of duty swerved.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 19]</span>
I have my sins and woes confessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ask forgiveness, peace and rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh grant the mercy which I crave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or I shall find an early grave!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To such petition all unused,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With faltering words and eyes suffused,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kind Orrin made this brief reply:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The same true friends are you and I;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As we have ever been before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We will be now and evermore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And since you mourn this first offence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With deep and humble penitence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I grant forgiveness full and free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trust no lapse again to see."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To banish care and doubt and fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And waken hope and faith and cheer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good Orrin, with a tact supreme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From great to small then changed his theme.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My dog," quoth he, "with morning sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll see what can for you be done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There comes just now this happy thought&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For you a collar shall be bought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="pgno">[pg 20]</span>
That if perchance you go astray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You will be known, though far away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On it must be inscribed your name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Latin words to give you fame!<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nil desperandum</i>, they shall be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from despair may you be free!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What more did pass between these friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The curtain now around descends;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their mutual joys, their mutual woes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poet's pen may not disclose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dog and master, both so true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long life and peace, and our adieu.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now turning from the gay or sad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This moral we will simply add:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye maidens fair and comely youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accept the words of love and truth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Not all is gold with golden gleam,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Not all are friends who friendly seem;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The</i> <span class="smcapall">TRIED</span>, <i>the</i> <span class="smcapall">TRUSTED</span> <i>and the</i> <span class="smcapall">TRUE</span>,<br /></span>
